# Summer Training Projects - Red Hat System Administration

This repository contains the shell scripts created during my Red Hat System Administration I (RH124) and II (RH134) training. Each script performs a specific system administration task, helping automate various aspects of managing a Linux system.

## Task 1: User Account Creation
**Script Name**: `task1_user_account_creation.sh`  
This script automates the process of creating a user account in Linux. It allows the system administrator to input a username, password, and other necessary details. Error handling is implemented to check if the user already exists.

## Task 2: Disk Usage Report
**Script Name**: `task2_disk_usage_report.sh`  
Generates a detailed disk usage report for all mounted file systems. The script displays the available, used, and total disk space, helping administrators monitor and manage storage more effectively.

## Task 4: Service Monitoring
**Script Name**: `task4_service_monitoring.sh`  
Monitors the status of a specified service (e.g., `httpd`, `sshd`). If the service is not running, it will attempt to restart it and send a notification email to the administrator, ensuring essential services remain available.

## Task 5: Log Rotation
**Script Name**: `task5_log_rotation.sh`  
This script helps manage log files by automating their rotation. It compresses, archives, or deletes old log files based on predefined criteria, ensuring that log files donâ€™t consume excessive disk space.

## Task 9: System Information Script
**Script Name**: `task9_system_info.sh`  
Displays essential system information such as CPU usage, memory usage, disk space, and network details. This script is useful for quickly retrieving vital system metrics.
